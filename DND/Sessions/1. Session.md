## Summary of this session
---
> We began in [[DND/World/Sword-Coast/Towns/Neverwinter]], having accepted a job from [[Gundren Rockseeker]] to transport supplies to [[Phandalin]]. Gundren and [Sildar Hallwinter](../World/Sword_coast/NPCs/Sildar_Hallwinter.md) rode ahead. A couple of days from Phandalin, we stumbled upon a scene with dead horses, presumably belonging to Gundren and Sildar, and were ambushed by goblins. We fought off the goblins, captured one, and learned of a nearby hideout where we suspected Gundren and Sildar were held. After infiltrating the goblin hideout, we defeated their leader, a bugbear named Clark, and rescued Sildar. We found various loot, including Lionshield Coster crates. Sildar informed us that Gundren had likely been taken to [[Cragmaw Castle]] by someone known as the “Black Spider.” We heard mention of a woman named Nainine in Phandalin who might be interested in the Lionshield Coster items we recovered. We agreed to escort Sildar to Phandalin for a reward of 50 gp total, and we now head there to regroup and continue our search for Gundren and his missing map.
