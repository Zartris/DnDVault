And I was thinking of it being a Devouring blade of ... which can transform into any weapon it has devoured. This way I can change my weapons without losing roleplay potential.














# Weapon concept
**Character:** Kaelen Veylith (Half-Drow Paladin/Hexblade)  
**Campaign Setting:** Highmoon, Dalelands  
**Requested Feature:** A **cursed, devouring weapon** that integrates **game mechanics and roleplay depth** without unbalancing gameplay.  

---

## **1. Core Concept: The Devouring Weapon**
Kaelen wields a **cursed weapon**, a living entity that **feeds on blood and consumes other weapons to take their form**.  
- **It does not care whose blood it drinks—it only seeks to be fed.**  
- **Kaelen was born into this curse**, his family bound to the weapon for generations.  
- His **training as a Paladin** is a way to **resist and control the hunger**, rather than surrender to it.  

---

## **2. How the Hunger System Works**
The weapon **must feed regularly** or it will **begin to take from Kaelen himself**.  

| **Method of Feeding** | **Effect on the Weapon** | **Downsides/Consequences** |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Defeating a worthy opponent (humanoid/strong creature)** | Fully satisfies the hunger. | No penalties. |
| **Using his own blood (Self-Sacrifice Option)** | Resets the hunger, but... **Kaelen starts the next day at 70% HP.** | - **Weakened for a full day** <br> - **Roleplay exhaustion effects** <br> - **-1d3 to all RP checks for the day (Persuasion, Insight, Intimidation, etc.)** |
| **Stored Blood (Vials from worthy foes)** | Temporarily **delays hunger for 1-2 days**. | - **Blood expires after a few days** (not a permanent solution). |
| **Prayer & Discipline (Church of Tyr rituals)** | Slows hunger progression **for 1-2 additional days.** | - Requires **dedicated time to prayer** (not an instant fix). |
| **Unwilling Sacrifice (Cutting Someone Without Killing Them)** | **Temporarily resets hunger**. | - Creates **moral and social conflicts**—not something Kaelen will willingly do. |

## **3. If Kaelen Uses His Own Blood…**
Kaelen can **sacrifice his own blood** to control the weapon, but it is costly.  

- **The next day, he starts with 70% of his max HP.**  
- He suffers **roleplay exhaustion**—weakened movements, sluggishness, dizziness.  
- He takes **-1d3 to all roleplay ability checks** for the day (representing fatigue, slow reflexes, and distraction).  
- **This effect resets after a full day** (or magical healing if the DM allows).  

This **ensures self-sacrifice is an option**, but it **remains a last resort.**  

---

## **4. What Happens If the Weapon Starves?**
If **Kaelen does not feed the weapon for too long**, it **gradually punishes him**, rather than causing immediate damage.  

| **Hunger Level**  | **Effect on Kaelen** |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Satisfied**  | No problems—the weapon is stable. |
| **Mild Hunger** (One missed feeding) | Kaelen **feels slightly restless**, but no major effects. |
| **Moderate Hunger** (Two long rests unfed) | **Weapon feels heavier**, Kaelen’s grip **shakes slightly** when holding it. |
| **Severe Hunger** (Three long rests unfed) | **Kaelen hears whispers**, has **restless dreams**, and loses **1d6 HP upon waking.** |
| **Starving** (Four+ long rests unfed) | Kaelen **blacks out for moments**—when he regains awareness, the weapon is **already in his hand, dripping blood.** |

This **builds tension over time**, rather than forcing the player into combat encounters just to satisfy the weapon.

## **5. How the Weapon Behaves (DM Information)**
- **It is a sentient entity** but does not **recklessly seek Kaelen’s death.**  
- **It knows Kaelen is valuable**—if he dies, it must wait years to find a new host.  
- It **expects blood within Kaelen’s capabilities**—no more, no less.  
- **It does not force him into battle,** but it **will take from him if it is not fed.**  

---

## **6. Why This is Balanced & Fun**
✅ **Scales With Level:** The HP loss from self-sacrifice **is a percentage, not a fixed number**, making it always meaningful.  
✅ **Creates Roleplay Choices:** Kaelen has multiple ways to **manage hunger**—combat, prayer, vials, or self-sacrifice.  
✅ **Avoids Being a Punishment:** The **weapon does not automatically punish Kaelen**—it **builds pressure over time.**  
✅ **Encourages Creative Problem-Solving:** Instead of **forcing combat**, it **allows for alternative ways** to manage hunger.  
✅ **Works With a Non-Combat Heavy Campaign:** Since combat is **not as frequent in this campaign**, Kaelen can **rely on vials, prayer, and choices beyond just killing.**
